# Week 3 

## Advanced Visualizations and Geospatial Data

In this module, you will learn about advanced visualization tools such as waffle charts and word clouds and how to create them. You will also learn about seaborn, which is another visualization library, and how to use it to generate attractive regression plots. In addition, you will learn about Folium, which is another visualization library, designed especially for visualizing geospatial data. Finally, you will learn how to use Folium to create maps of different regions of the world and how to superimpose markers on top of a map, and how to create choropleth maps.

## Learning Objectives

- Demonstrate how to use advanced visualization tools to create waffle charts and word clouds.
- Demonstrate how to use Seaborn with Matlib to generate attractive regression plots.
- Demonstrate how to use Folium to create maps and superpose markers
- Describe the use of Folium, which is another visualization library, designed especially for visualizing geospatial data.
- Demonstrate how to create Choropleth Maps with Folium
