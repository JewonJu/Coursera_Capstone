Credit Cards

#### Next, you will play the role of the client and the data scientist. Using the topic that you selected, complete the Business Understanding stage by coming up with a problem that you would like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a question that you will use data to answer. (3 marks)

**Problem:** JP Morgan Chase wants to determine the best way to advertise their new student credit card. They want to know what time of the year, what platform, what geographical region, and potential market size.

**Question:** What is the optimal method of advertizing the new student credit card?

#### Briefly explain how you would complete each of the following stages for the problem that you described in the Business Understanding stage, so that you are ultimately able to answer the question that you came up with. (5 marks):

1. Analytic Approach
2. Data Requirements
3. Data Collection
4. Data Understanding and Preparation
5. Modeling and Evaluation

**Answer:**

1. **Analytics Approach:** We will use a descriptive analytics approach to determine the best way to advertise the new product using historical credit card data.

2. **Data Requirements:** We need to have information about the demographics of the new credit card users, geographical locations, previous data on different types of advertisement campaigns by JP Morgan Chase and other financial institutions, the size of the market, and when the target audiences tend to open new credit cards.

3. **Data Collection:** We will be combining data from our previous credit card users as well as mining data from other financial institutions.

4. **Data Understanding and Preparation:** We will first make sure there are no missing values and duplicates. We will also make sure all the variables are in the correct data type. Then we will merge the tables from different sources using relational databases. Then we will get some descriptive statistics and visualizations to gain more insights about the data.

5. **Modeling and Evaluation:** We will be building a dashboard that contains answers to all our questions. Then we will implement the strategy we conclude from our analysis. Then we will run more models based on new data after the implementation of our strategy and make appropriate adjustments to our model and strategy.
